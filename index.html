<h2 id="generic-zk-snark-scheme">Generic zk-SNARK scheme</h2>
<h3 id="preliminaries">Preliminaries</h3>
<p>A zk-SNARK (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-interactive ARgument of Knowledge) is a general purpose cryptographic scheme for generating and verifying zero-knowledge proofs in efficient and non-interactive fashion. Statements to be proven are claims of knowledge of a quantity <em>w</em> (called <em>withness</em>) satisfying <em>F(x, w)</em>, where <em>x</em> is a public quantity (called <em>instance</em>) and <em>F</em> is a public relation (called <em>predicate</em>). More accurately, without revealing info about <em>w</em>, the prover wishes to generate a proof of the following statement:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{given } x \in X \text{ and } F: X \times W \mapsto \{0,
        1\}, \text{ I know a } w \text{ such that } F(x, w) = 1
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is the set of acceptable public instances, <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> is the set of acceptable private witnesses and 0, 1 hold their usual logical meanings. For example, if the verifier were a web server holding a database of hashed passwords and the prover were the web client of a registered user, the latter does not need to send their password <em>w</em> (as cleartext or in disguise) in order to login, but only a proof of the above statement with predicate:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ F(x, w) := \{H(w) = x\}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> is the hash function used by the server, <em>W</em> being the preimage set and <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> the set of stored hashed passwords in the database. To give a more relevant example from the cryptocurrency framework, if <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> were the encoding of the private payment details of a particular transaction and <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> the encrypted version of this data, then the predicate <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> would typically be</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ F(x, w) = \{w \text{ is a well-formed transaction and } x
        \text{ is the encryption of it}\} \]</span></p>
<p>Note that <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is predefined and fixed, which allows for <em>non-interactive</em> mode (see below). Generation and verification of proofs for various witness-instance pairs <span class="math inline">\((w, x)\)</span> is instead a massively repeated procedure. Efficiency of the cryptosystem refers thus not to its initial setup (which only involves <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>) but to the generation and verification of proofs (involving arbitrary instantiations of <span class="math inline">\((w, x)\)</span> pairs), which naturally leads to the notion of <em>succinctness</em> (see below).</p>
<h3 id="predicate-reduction">Predicate reduction</h3>
<p>In theory, any NP-complete statement which is expressible in the above form may serve as the fixed public predicate of a zk-SNARK cryptosystem. However, transforming the predicate so that it be amenable to low-level cryptographic operations is a genuine challenge. That is, except if following recipes, configuration of the cryptosystem may well be a non-trivial step from the implementors' viewpoint.</p>
<p>After completion of the initial setup, the predicate <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> may be thought of as a fixed circuit of logical gates. In a blockchain context, this means to encode in the form of a circuit the consensus rules of the network. Satisfaction of <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> for a witness-instance pair <span class="math inline">\((w, x)\)</span> emulates a particular state of the circuit after running it with that input. zk-SNARK libraries usually avail a mechanism for modelling predicates as logical circuits which resembles the concept of <em>protoboard</em> (prototyping board) from electrical engineering: the cryptosystem's configuration presupposes allocation of <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>'s &quot;chips&quot; to the protoboard.</p>
<p>This is however only a convenient abstraction. What in fact one must do is appropriately reduce the NP-statement <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> to a quadratic system of polynomial equations. Satisfiability of <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> for a given pair <span class="math inline">\((w, x)\)</span> amounts to <span class="math inline">\((x, w)\)</span> being (with overwhelming probability) a solution to this system of equations. More specifically, it has been proven that any NP-complete statement can be reduced to such system of a special kind, usually referred to as a <em>set of quadratic constraints</em>, with each zk-SNARK proof attesting that this set of constraints is satisfied by some concrete input. Further results show that any set of quadratic constraints can be conveniently flattened to what is known as <em>R1CS</em> (<em>Rank 1 Constraint System</em>). Predicate reduction amounts thus to reformulating an NP-complete statement as R1CS.</p>
<h3 id="cryptographic-flow">Cryptographic flow</h3>
<p>We expose here the ZS-NARK cryptographic flow for reference, in order to gradually attain semi-formal language and terminology. The flow involves three basic algorithms run by homonymous and mutually independent components: <em>Setup</em>, <em>Prover</em> and <em>Verifier</em>. How these components are distributed among network entities depends on the protocol under implementation.</p>
<p>The Setup algorithm is typically run once by a unanimously trusted party. It is fed with a R1CS (i.e., the fixed public predicate <em>F</em>) and outputs the public CRS (<em>Common Reference String</em>) involved in any subsequent proof generation and verification. In particular, the CRS consists of a proving key <em>pk</em> (uniformly used by all Provers) and a uniquely correlated verification key <em>vk</em> (uniformly used by all Verifiers). Computation of CRS involves also a once used randomness <span class="math inline">\(\mathit{lambda}\)</span>, so that it can formally be expressed as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ (F, \mathit{lambda}) \mapsto CRS := (pk, vk) =
   \mathrm{Setup}(F, \mathit{lambda})\]</span></p>
<p>It is essential that <span class="math inline">\(\mathit{lambda}\)</span> remains forever secret: leakage of randomness would allow a malicious prover to generate false proofs that can erroneously be verified. Trustedness of the Setup party must thus be equivalent to the unanimously accepted guarantee, that the <span class="math inline">\(\mathit{lambda}\)</span> parameter has irreversibly been eliminated after CRS generation (which is the reason for the destruction ceremonies surrounding ZCash etc.).</p>
<p>Upon every proof generation, the Prover is fed with a public instance <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and a secret witness <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> for it. Using the proving part <span class="math inline">\(\mathit{pk}\)</span> of the CRS, the prover generates a proof <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> attesting that <span class="math inline">\(F(x, \cdot)\)</span> is satisfiable by some known <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span>, without disclosing any info about <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> (i.e., except for the claim that it is known). This can formally be expressed as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ (\mathit{pk}, x, w) \mapsto \pi = Prover(\mathit{pk}, x, w) \]</span></p>
<p>The Verifier uses the verifying part <span class="math inline">\(\mathit{vk}\)</span> of the CRS to operate upon the provided proof, accepting or rejecting according to whether it was found to be valid, resp. invalid:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ (vk, x, \pi) \mapsto Verifier(vk, x, \pi) \in \{0, 1\} \]</span></p>
<p>Note that typically anyone can run a Verifier.</p>
<p>The whole flow is summarized in the following figure:</p>
<p>...[Figure] (1)</p>
<p>In this context, the zk-SNARK properties are formalized as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>zk</em> (<em>Zero Knowledge</em>): The generated proof conveys no info about <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> beyond the claim of it being known, i.e., that <span class="math inline">\(F(x, .)\)</span> is satisfied by it.</p></li>
<li><p><em>S</em> (<em>Succint</em>): The size of proofs is small, constant and independent of the system's constraints and public inputs. More accurately, ignoring dependence on security parameters, proof generation is <span class="math inline">\(O(1)\)</span> and verification is <span class="math inline">\(O(k)\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> stands for the proof uniform bitsize. The bottleneck of initial setup needs not be taken into account.</p></li>
<li><p><em>N</em> (<em>Non-interactive</em>): The only interaction between Prover and Verifier is the transmission of the produced proof (one communication step). Any intermediate computation required for proof generation and verification has been absorbed in the precomputation of the CRS (involved via usage of <span class="math inline">\(\mathit{pk}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathit{vk}\)</span>).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Generic requirements may also be formalized as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Completeness</em>: Correct proofs (i.e., generated upon a correct witness by a honest prover) always verify. More accurately,</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math display">\[
  \begin{align*}
  &amp;\textrm{for any } \pi =
  \mathrm{Prover}(pk, x, w) \textrm{ such that } F(x, w) = 1,\\
  &amp;\textrm{there holds } \mathrm{Verifier}(vk, x, \pi) = 1
  \end{align*}
  \]</span></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Soundness</em>: No false proof (i.e., generated upon incorrect witness by a malicious prover) ever verifies. More accurately,</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math display">\[
  \begin{align*}
  &amp;\textrm{for any } x \textrm{ such that } F(x, .)
  \textrm{ not satisfiable, there exists no } w \text{ such that } \\
  &amp;\mathrm{Verifier}(vk, x, \pi) = 1 \text{ with } \pi =
  \mathrm{Prover}(pk, x, w)
  \end{align*}
  \]</span></p>
<h3 id="libsnark-library"><code>libsnark</code> library</h3>
<p>In view of the above nomenclature, we will here try to determine respective API calls to the <code>libsnark</code> library. Note that in the Libsnark unofficial documentation and terminology, the Setup component is referred to as <em>generator</em>, public instances as <em>primary inputs</em> and secret witnesses as <em>auxiliary inputs</em>.</p>
<p>Libsnark provides a class <code>protoboard</code> for generating CRSs upon arbitrary R1CS circuits, i.e., allowing for great configurability with respect to the public predicate. This is crucial for our use case, since the consensus rules to be modelled are not precisely known in advance. It should be nevertheless mentioned that Libsnark provides also a series of <em>gadgets</em>, i.e., ready made wrappers around protoboards that automatically handle R1CS and witness generation for a broad range of special cases. These functionalities are the <code>generate_r1cs_constraints()</code> and <code>generate_r1cs_witness()</code> public methods of gadget objects respectively.</p>
<h3 id="libsnark-api-calls"><code>libsnark</code> API calls</h3>
<h4 id="r1cs-generation">R1CS generation</h4>
<p>We first need to initialize elliptic curve parameters:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c">default_r1cs_ppzksnark_pp::init_public_params();
<span class="kw">typedef</span> libff::Fr&lt;default_r1cs_ppzksnark_pp&gt; FieldT;</code></pre></div>
<p>Protoboard creation and allocation of variables upon it proceeds as follows:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c">protoboard&lt;FieldT&gt; pb;

pb_variable&lt;FieldT&gt; var_1;
pb_variable&lt;FieldT&gt; var_2;
...

var_1.allocate(pb, <span class="st">&quot;var_1&quot;</span>);
var_2.allocate(pb, <span class="st">&quot;var_2&quot;</span>);
...</code></pre></div>
<p>We can then specify that the first <em>n</em> variables constitute primary input (i.e., public instance) as follows:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c">pb.set_input_sizes(n);</code></pre></div>
<p>in which case the last <span class="math inline">\(m - n\)</span> variables will correspond to auxiliary input (i.e., secret witness). It is then straightforward to impose quadratic constraints on the above allocated variables by means of the <code>add_r1cs_constraint()</code> method. For example, a constraint <code>var_1 ^ 2 = var_3</code> would be enforced as follows:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c">pb.add_r1cs_constraint(r1cs_constraint&lt;FieldT&gt;(var_1, var_1, var_3));</code></pre></div>
<p>After imposing further constraints, the resulting circuit is finally exported:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c">r1cs_constraint_system&lt;FieldT&gt; constraint_system = pb.get_constraint_system();</code></pre></div>
<h4 id="setup">Setup</h4>
<p>Once reduced to a R1CS as above, the public predicate can be fed to the CRS generator:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c">r1cs_ppzksnark_keypair&lt;ppT&gt; keypair = r1cs_ppzksnark_generator&lt;ppT&gt;(r1cs_constraint_system);</code></pre></div>
<p>If one wishes to make use of the Groth16 zk-SNARK protocol, the above statement may slightly be modified as follows:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c">r1cs_gg_ppzksnark_keypair&lt;ppT&gt; keypair = r1cs_gg_ppzksnark_generator&lt;ppT&gt;(r1cs_constraint_system);</code></pre></div>
<p>In either case, the proving and verification keys are directly accessible as the <code>pk</code> and <code>vk</code> attributes of the generated keypair (see below).</p>
<h4 id="prover">Prover</h4>
<p>Given the above CRS <code>keypair</code>, proof generation proceeds as follows:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c">r1cs_ppzksnark_proof&lt;ppT&gt; proof = r1cs_ppzksnark_prover&lt;ppT&gt;(keypair.pk, pb.primary_input(), pb.auxiliary_input());</code></pre></div>
<p>In the Groth16 zk-SNARK protocol, the corresponding formulation would be</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c">r1cs_gg_ppzksnark_proof&lt;ppT&gt; proof = r1cs_gg_ppzksnark_prover&lt;ppT&gt;(keypair.pk, pb.primary_input(), pb.auxiliary_input());</code></pre></div>
<h4 id="verifier">Verifier</h4>
<p>The above generated <code>proof</code> can be verified as follows:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c">bool ans = r1cs_ppzksnark_verifier_strong_IC&lt;ppT&gt;(keypair.vk, pb.primary_input(), proof);</code></pre></div>
<p>with the corresponding Groth16 formulation being</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c">bool ans = r1cs_gg_ppzksnark_verifier_strong_IC&lt;ppT&gt;(keypair.vk, pb.primary_input(), proof);</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="optimizing-verification">Optimizing verification</h3>
<p>For the purpose of faster verification, <code>vk</code> can be further processed during the initial setup, yielding the so called <em>processed verification key</em> <code>pvk</code>. In particular, a small amount of extra precomputed info can be added to it, in which case the Verifier algorithm must also be modified appropriately (<em>online</em> Verifier). In this case, Figure 1 transforms as follows:</p>
<p>... [Figure] (2)</p>
<p>In Libsnark, preprocessing of the verification key corresponds to the following statement:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c">r1cs_ppzksnark_processed_verification_key&lt;ppT&gt; pvk = r1cs_ppzksnark_verifier_process_vk&lt;ppT&gt;(keypair.vk);</code></pre></div>
<p>Proof verification should then proceed as follows:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c">bool ans = r1cs_ppzksnark_online_verifier_strong_IC&lt;ppT&gt;(pvk, pb.primary_input(), proof);</code></pre></div>
<p>the corresponding Groth16 statement being</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c">bool ans = r1cs_gg_ppzksnark_online_verifier_strong_IC&lt;ppT&gt;(pvk,
pb.primary_input(), proof);</code></pre></div>
<p>Note that proof generation is not affected by the usage of preprocessed verification keys.</p>
