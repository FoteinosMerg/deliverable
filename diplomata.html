<h1 id="anonymous-proof-of-possession-in-the-context-of-diplomata-record-ledger-uc3">Anonymous Proof of Possession in the context of Diplomata Record Ledger (UC3)</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p><em>Diplomata</em> is a proposed system for proving and verifying title possession in a privacy-preserving fashion. It involves three kinds of interacting network entities: <em>Holders</em> of qualifications, which they can present to interested parties, <em>Issuers</em> capable of issuing qualifications to holders, and <em>Verifiers</em> able to verify the holders' claims of possessing a title. Awarding of titles, requests of certification, acknowledgments of certification etc. are all recorded in the form of transaction in a blockchain ledger, in order for the involved entities to be held publicly accountable for their actions. Requirements like <em>access control</em> on behalf of the holders, resistance to <em>no honesty</em> and <em>auditability</em> by external observers are also satisfied.</p>
<p>A <em>ZK-Decryptor Protocol</em> (<em>ZKD</em>) has already been proposed on top of an El-Gamal cryptosystem, that allows holders to (indirectly) prove possession of titles to verifiers. However, the Issuer of the title is heavily involved in the process. Except for an initial certification request and the private communication of the accompanying commitment to the Verifier, the rest of communication takes place between Issuer and Verifier: it is the <em>Issuer</em> who actually commits and generates the proof of award that will be finally verified. More importantly, verification of proof presupposes that the (content of the) title will be decrypted by the Verifier and thus <em>disclosed</em> to them, i.e., &quot;zero-knowledge&quot; does not refer to the qualification itself. Since the title contains as such reference to the Holder's identity, this entails <em>non</em>-anonymity for the Holder.</p>
<p>Purpose of this text is to propose an alternative to the <em>ZKD</em> protocol for the case where the Holder's anonymity is desired and the (content of the) title should not be revealed. This pertains to the following meritocratic scenario: Holder and Verifier meet anonymously online and the Holder wishes to prove <em>for themselves</em> possession of a title <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>without revealing their identity (public key)</li>
<li>without disclosing any info about <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, except for the claim that it exists among their acquired qualifications</li>
<li>in one single communication step</li>
<li>without involvement of anybody else in that step (say, the Issuer of <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>).</li>
</ol>
<p>The proposed protocol will be referred to as <em>Anonymous Proof of Possession Protocol</em> (<em>APP</em>). Proof of possession should be thought of as proof of <em>inclusion</em> in a set of recordedly awarded titles (possibly of a special kind) strongly correlated to the prover's (unrevealed) identity. In doing so, we employ the <em>zk-SNARK</em> cryptographic scheme combined with a commitment mechanism. In particular, proof of possession is a zk-SNARK proof.</p>
<p>Such a construction will partly resemble the <em>ZeroCash</em> anonymous payment scheme, with each title interpreted as 1 BTC (bitcoin) and the holders' commitments recorded in the public ledger. There are however two major differences:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>No &quot;Direct Anonymous Payment&quot; method is here facilitated, that is, transfer of titles(=coins) from holder to holder is <em>not</em> anyhow taken into account. This allows to stay away from the intricacies of the key-address machinery surrounding commitments in the ZeroCash cryptographic flow.</p></li>
<li><p>Except for the Prover(=Holder) and Verifier, a third party, the <em>Issuer</em>, is responsible for recording the Holder's commitment: contrary to the commitment to a coin's serial number, the Holder's commitment to a title's serial number is appended to the ledger not by the Holder, but by the Issuer (see Step 3 below for details). Note however that this involvement does <em>not</em> violate requirement 4: it takes place <em>prior to</em> generation and transmission of any proof of possession for <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> (the communication step mentioned in requirement 3). More specifically, <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> is restricted to once participating in the common setup of these proofs, without actually involving to any of them.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>It should be finally stressed that the here proposed <em>APP</em> protocol is not intended to replace <em>ZKD</em> and should not be considered as an improvement of it. It is rather complementary to it in the context of a <em>Diplomata</em> application, whenever the utmost degree of anonymity is desired. In fact, <em>APP</em> has some practical drawbacks compared to <em>ZKD</em>:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Anonymity is at the cost of the Verifier's inability to check for certificate revocation. That is, if certificate revocation is supported by the system, then the proposed proof of possession is only equivalent to a <em>proof of acquisition</em>. In order for the Verifier to verify that a title is <em>still</em> possessed by a Holder, they will have to proceed to a second stage and run some additional, possibly non-anonymous proof-verify session (say, in the <em>ZKD</em> context).</li>
<li>Being a zk-SNARK protocol, <em>APP</em>'s setup presupposes a public ceremony for destroying the randomness used in the Common Reference String (CRS) generation.</li>

<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> be a title held by a Holder <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> and issued by Issuer <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>. In order for <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> to be able to anonymously prove possession of <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> at any future moment, the following Steps 1-3 must take place (once per t).</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Upon issuance of <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> uniquely assigns to it a serial number <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>, which they record to the public ledger and privately communicate to <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> requests from <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> to record their commitment to <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> in the public ledger. In particular, <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> chooses a secret trapdoor <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> and computes a commitment <span class="math display">\[c = Comm(r, s)\]</span> which they privately communicate to <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>. This commitment is generated once per <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> and will be used in any subsequent prove-verify session concerning this title.</p></li>
<li><p>Being the issuer of <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> verifies and approves <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span>'s commitment to <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>, which they subsequently append to the public ledger. Note that only the issuer <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> should be able to approve <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> and record it in the ledger. In the cryptocurrency terminology, approval on behalf of <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> is equivalent to a guaratee that <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> has spent 1 BTC to an escrow pool. <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> can anytime check whether <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> has indeed been recorded, since the ledger is public.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><em>I</em> needs never again interact with either <em>H</em> or any possible verifier. Their role is limited in approving the record <em>c</em>, which serves as disguise of <em>s</em>, and thus <em>t</em>, in the public ledger. This disguise guarantees that proofs of possession of <em>t</em> are indeed &quot;zero-knowledge&quot; with respect to it, since they will only contain references to <em>c</em>.</p>
